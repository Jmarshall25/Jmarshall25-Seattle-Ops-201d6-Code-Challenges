# About My Repo!

What is this repo all about?

-This repo showcases the multiple codes I have began to learn during my Ops 201 class. 


Why are you learning these skills?

-I am learning these skills because they provide basic knowledge to a set of instructions for the computer to follow. 


What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

-During Ops 201 I learned anout loops, arrays, if/then and while statements, how to show and filter results. I learned not only how to write in bash but powershell as well.


What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

-My favorite Ops Challenge was 13 because I felt that everything was starting to click. I did not have to use help from the TAs or use ChatGPT. the only search i used was to install the "whois" command because that was not a recognized command.


How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

-I think one of the best examples is making a script that automatically saves files at the end of the day an creates a folder with the contents.


What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

-Any of my scripts that contain loops and variables. 


What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

-I want to become more proficient with writing scripts that use arrays, loops, and if/then all in one. I want to imporve at structuring my scripts better.
